            <p>A brief description of a thing goes here. It will go for as long as it needs to go. I hope we all enjoy this very much. Will it ever end? Perhaps more will go here, but who knows really. I mean, nothing is certain in life. Except for taxes and death.</p>

            <p>Wow...that's morbid. Ok, I'll think I'll stop now. But only after a bit more ranting. I mean, what is the deal with fish, right? There's just something about it I cannot put my finger on.</p>

        <p>Earthlings are interesting creatures. Living on the moon makes it easy to see things at a <emphasis>macro</emphasis> level. Investigating subjects while completely removing myself from all context. I find both <emphasis>Anthropology & Psychology</emphasis> fascinating and endeavor to understand the root reasons/motivations behind a user's actions. It's always better to see than to be told.</p>

        <p>While I'm able to zoom in on as something as granular as a button's placement, I can also go way out to establish the system in place. This can take the form of a <emphasis>Strategist</emphasis> or <emphasis>Service Designer</emphasis>.</p>
