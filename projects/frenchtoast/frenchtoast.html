        <p><b>THE CLIENT:</b> <img src="img/logo.svg" alt="French Toast logo" style="max-height: 4.0rem; width: auto;"></p>

        <p><b>ABOUT:</b> French Toast is a company that sells school uniforms for K-12. They partner with schools to coordinate a selection of garments to meet each dress & uniform code requirements. They were interested in a site redesign that would work well both for those browsing the entire site, but also parents who were sent an email checklist of specific types of clothes.</p>

        <p><b>ROLE:</b> UXA</p>

        <p><b>METHODS USED</b> Heuristic evaluation, card sorting, site map, user flows, sketching, prototyping, wireframing, and usability testing.</p>

    <h3>RESEARCH AND FINDINGS</h3>

    <section class="column__container column__one">
        <p><b>PERSONAS:</b> The bulk of French Toast users are parents with various nuances. I was given a few personas that demonstrated French Toasts typical users. With that information, my surveys, and interviews, and synthesis I uncovered insights:</p>

        <p>1) Users view this type of experience as a task rather than pleasurable.</p>

        <p>2) Users want things to be effortless (no barriers).</p>

        <p>3) Users want to get things done FAST!</p>

        <img src="img/graphic-frenchtoast2.jpg" alt="card sorting">
        <p><b>CARD SORTING:</b> I asked for a list of all the products to be sold on the True Spirit site and began card sorting with users. This was beneficial both for the categorization of products and creating my site map.</p>

            <p><b>SITEMAP:</b> For ease of searching and loading new pages home page/product gallery is a single scrolling page. Now users can casually view everything at once or filter their search through the side navigation.</p>

        <section class="column column--right">
            <p><b>HOMEPAGE:</b> Many of the schools will send emails to parents with link(s) to specific garments that fit their dress code. Those who click on a school link will be taken to a curated landing page that only shows the products deemed acceptable by the school. For ease of searching and less loading of pages I made the product gallery a single page.</p>

            <p><b>PRODUCT PAGE:</b> I wanted to limit the steps between finding a product and buying it. In doing this I made the site simpler with less opportunities to get lost. I endeavored to make the entire site a 3-step process.</p>
            <p>1. Find product(s)<br>
            2. Select size & color<br>
            3. Checkout</p>

            <p><b>ACCOUNTS:</b> My audience are young parents, busy parents who, in interviews, mentioned not wanting more accounts to manage. I was curious what social platforms were most common amongst the users. Most everyone I surveyed had either a Facebook or Gmail account. With that, implemented an option to use an existing Gmail or Facebook account instead of creating a new unique account. This worked well in User Testing.</p>
